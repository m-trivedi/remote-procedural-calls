Important Information ----------
- How are payloads set up?
- Payloads consist of 5 fields:
    - 1. Function (Idle: 0, Get: 1, Put: 2)
    - 2. Client ID
    - 3. Sequence Number
    - 4. Key (Get, Put) / Time (Idle)
    - 5. Value (Put)
- These fields are communicated in the form of a space separated string.
- Upon packet arrival, the data is split into an int array (arr[5]) using strtok. 


Project Implementation So Far ----------
Last Updated: 5/2/2023 5:30 AM

Completed:
 - Basic server-client communication complete.
 - Idle, Get, Put functions complete on both server, client end.

In Progress:
 - Implementation of ACK by Server affecting timer on client end
 - Implementation of multiple client request handling using pthreads
 - Implementation of client id, seq number bookeeping via structs on server end
